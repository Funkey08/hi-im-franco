          Ever since I joined a neurocomputational lab in my freshman year, Iâ€™ve
          been captivated by the power of{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">
            statistics, machine learning, and data visualization
          </span>{" "}
          to transform complex information into clear, actionable insights.{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">
            Since then, Iâ€™ve pursued this passion beyond neuroscience
          </span>{" "}
          across several domains â€” from computational social science and
          experimental design to biotechnology and digital health.

            The process of exploration is what excites me the most!

          Iâ€™m experienced in{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">
            Python, R, Java, SQL, JavaScript, and MATLAB,
          </span>{" "}
          and I regularly use analytical tools like{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">
            Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, PyTorch, Dplyr, and Seaborn.

          I enjoy building interfaces and tools for exploring and interacting
          with data using{" "}
          <span className="font-semibold">
            React, Vite, TailwindCSS, Tableau,

          When Iâ€™m not looking at numbers, youâ€™ll probably find me reading
          sci-fi, watching anime, exploring a new jRPG, learning a song on the
          piano or guitar, drawing, or walking around outside (and staring at
          the clouds).
          <br />
          <br />I want to commit myself to using technology to improve human
          learning, health, business, and logistics. Thanks for coming to see me
          on my journey! ðŸ˜„
